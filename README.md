# hello-world
This is a practice repository I've created to familiarize myself with GitHub https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
I'm practicing making edits to a feature branch that I will merge with my master branch once I've completed my edits and saved changes with a commit. A feature branch is just a snap-shot of the master branch that can be manipulated separately and then merged back with the master branch. When the feature branch and master branches are merged, all changes are saved... I think.
Let me try this again. Once I commit, then I pull request, and if there aren't any conflicts, then I merge my feature and base branches. Then, make sure to delete the feature branch, unless you aren't done making changes to the base branch.
